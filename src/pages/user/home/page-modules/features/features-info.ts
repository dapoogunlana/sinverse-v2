            Sinverse originally begins as an undeveloped digital real estate with 15,000 parcels of land. As Sinverse 
            development kicks-off following the blueprint of the virtual city, the built Urban environment begins to 
            spring up. Anyone can purchase and own one or more parcel(s) of land in the city and develop them using SDK 
            kits provided in the development arena. We have partnered with Vulcan Verse to help develop the game, using 
            state of the art virtual reality technology; including the creation of a VR casino. In addition to this, the 
            platform will be built on Matic Network, an existing Vanilla Network partner, allowing for high speed & low 
            cost transactions.

            The Sinverse native game is a 3D action thriller game, which albeit fictional, is set and modeled after some 
            of the most controversial crime cities across the world. The play-to-earn game will be laced with violence and 
            gore bidding to become the ultimate Kingpin whilst building your empire. This will be built with realistic 
            imagery along with voice & text chat features with intent to pull players into an augmented reality space. The 
            game will be developed by the legendary Vulcan Verse development team with support from other game development 
            partners. Ultimate aim of gamers will be to conquer & control Sinverse and be designated as the ultimate Kingpin, 
            until the next conquerors emerge.

            Sinverse architecture is designed to provide a base platform for other limited partners to host their projects 
            inside the vast Metaverse arena. Therefore, this effectively makes Sinverse an Omniverse offering the rights to 
            host partnering projects inside the virtual world. This goes beyond onboarding high impact and scalable projects 
            but also includes providing land in a suitable destination to host these projects. Vanilla Network, Act it Out, 
            Drife and Sugar Bounce are some of the early projects that have passed a rigorous qualification process to be 
            onboarded into the Sinverse. The synergy of these projects and their capability with a Rated-R Metaverse creates 
            cross marketing opportunities, technology exchange and cross border relationships of various communities. 
            Resulting in a huge ecosystem of development partners and an increased number of users inside the Sinverse.
